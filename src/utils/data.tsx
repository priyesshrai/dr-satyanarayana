                    Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) & Acute Renal Failure

                <p className='mt-4'>
                    Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), also known as Acute Renal Failure, is a sudden loss of kidney function that develops within hours or days. It causes waste and fluid to build up in the body, which can be life-threatening if not treated quickly. With timely diagnosis and treatment, kidney function can often be restored fully or partially.

                    Kidney stones and urinary disorders are common conditions that can affect people of all ages. Kidney stones are hard deposits that form inside the kidneys, while urinary disorders include problems such as infections, frequent urination, or difficulty in passing urine. Early diagnosis and proper treatment help prevent complications and protect long-term kidney health.

                    Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. If not treated on time, CKD can progress to renal failure, where kidneys stop working completely and require dialysis or a transplant. Early detection and proper management can slow down the progression and improve quality of life.

                    Kidney transplantation is a surgical procedure where a healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor is placed into a patient whose kidneys have failed. It is often the best treatment option for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), offering improved quality of life compared to long-term dialysis. With proper care, a transplanted kidney can function for many years

                    Dialysis is a life-saving treatment for patients whose kidneys can no longer filter waste and excess fluid from the blood. It can be done through Hemodialysis, where blood is cleaned using a dialysis machine, or Peritoneal Dialysis, where a cleansing fluid is used inside the abdomen. Dialysis helps patients manage symptoms and maintain quality of life until a kidney transplant is possible.

                    High blood pressure (hypertension) and uncontrolled diabetes are two leading causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Over time, they damage the kidney&apos;s delicate blood vessels, reducing their ability to filter waste and excess fluids. Early detection and strict management of these conditions can significantly slow down kidney damage and protect overall health.

                    Inherited and rare kidney disorders are conditions passed down genetically or occurring infrequently in the population. These include Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD), Alport Syndrome, Bartter Syndrome, and Gitelman Syndrome. They affect kidney function differentlyâ€”some cause cyst formation, others lead to salt imbalance or progressive kidney failure. Early diagnosis and continuous care are essential to manage symptoms and slow progression.

                    Prevention plays a vital role in protecting kidney health and reducing the
                    risk of chronic diseases. With the right lifestyle habits, diet, and
                    regular health check-ups, many kidney problems can be delayed or avoided.
                    Preventive kidney care focuses on educating patients about healthy choices,
                    monitoring risk factors, and adopting practices that keep kidneys
                    functioning optimally.
