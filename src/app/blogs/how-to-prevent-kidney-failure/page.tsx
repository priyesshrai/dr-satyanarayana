                            Our kidneys are like natural filters of the body. They remove waste, balance fluids, keep blood pressure under control, and help produce red blood cells. When the kidneys stop working properly, it can lead to kidney failure, a life-threatening condition.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The important fact is that kidney failure does not usually happen overnight. It often develops slowly because of long-term health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or lifestyle habits. By taking care of your health and making small changes, you can protect your kidneys and prevent kidney failure.
                            <br />
                            In this article, let us look at simple and practical ways to keep kidneys healthy.

                            The first step in prevention is awareness. Some people are at a higher risk of kidney disease than others. The most common risk factors are:

                                <strong className='text-dark-navy'>Diabetes:</strong> High blood sugar damages the small blood vessels in the kidneys. Over time, this reduces their ability to filter waste.

                            <li>

                                <strong className='text-dark-navy'>Family history of kidney disease:</strong> If someone in your family has kidney problems, your risk is higher.

                            If you have any of these risk factors, it is important to visit a nephrologist for regular check-ups. Early detection gives you more options to slow down or even stop kidney damage.
