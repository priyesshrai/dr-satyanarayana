                            Kidney stones are hard mineral masses inside your kidneys or urinary tract. They can be very painful, but knowing the symptoms early helps in quick treatment and avoiding complications. Here are the common signs and what to watch out for.

                            What Are Kidney Stones?
                        </h2>
                        <Subheading className='text-left'>
                            Kidney stones (also called renal calculi or nephrolithiasis) form when wastes like calcium, oxalate, uric acid and other substances crystallize in the urine. Normally urine contains chemicals that prevent crystals, but if those chemicals are out of balance, or if you don&apos;t drink enough fluids, stones may form. Smaller stones may pass without causing much problem. Larger ones may block the flow of urine, causing pain and other symptoms.

                            When Do Symptoms Appear?

                        <Subheading className='text-left'>
                            You may not feel anything while a stone is in the kidney and not moving. Symptoms usually begin when the stone moves or blocks part of the urinary tract (for example, the ureter, which is the tube connecting kidney to bladder). When this happens, pain or other signs often follow.

                            Doctors usually ask about your symptoms and may do some tests:

                        <ul className='flex flex-col gap-1 list-disc pl-6 text-zinc-600 text-normal'>
                            <li>Urine test: to check for blood, crystals, and infection.</li>
                            <li>Blood tests: to see kidney function, possible mineral imbalances.</li>
                            <li>Imaging: ultrasound or CT scan to locate the stone, size, and if there is blockage.</li>

                            Early diagnosis helps in planning treatment—maybe medications, drinking more water, or in some cases procedures to remove or break the stone.

                        <Subheading className='text-left'>
                            Kidney stones often begin without any warning, but once they move or block the urinary tract, they cause strong symptoms. Knowing these symptoms helps you seek help early, reducing pain, preventing infections, and avoiding kidney damage.
