                            Kidney problems are becoming common today due to diabetes, high blood pressure, unhealthy food habits, and stress. When kidneys are not working properly, they cannot remove waste, extra fluids, and minerals from the body. This can slowly affect your overall health.<br /><br />

The right diet can reduce the load on your kidneys, control symptoms, and help slow down further damage. Under the guidance of an experienced nephrologist like <strong>Dr.SatyanarayanaGarre, Nephrology Specialist in Hyderabad</strong>, patients can maintain better kidney health with proper food choices.
