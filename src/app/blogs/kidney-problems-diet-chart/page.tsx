                            Kidney problems are becoming common today due to diabetes, high blood pressure, unhealthy food habits, and stress. When kidneys are not working properly, they cannot remove waste, extra fluids, and minerals from the body. This can slowly affect your overall health.<br /><br />
                            A well-planned kidney problems diet chart plays an important role in managing kidney disease. The right diet can reduce the load on your kidneys, control symptoms, and help slow down further damage. Under the guidance of an experienced nephrologist like <strong>Dr.SatyanarayanaGarre, Nephrology Specialist in Hyderabad</strong>, patients can maintain better kidney health with proper food choices.

                            When kidney function reduces, waste products and extra minerals start building up in the blood. This may lead to swelling, tiredness, high blood pressure, weak bones, and heart problems.

                            Blood tests are done to check clotting and infection risk. Patients are asked to fast for a few hours.

                            The procedure is done under local anesthesia using ultrasound and X-ray guidance. A tunnel is created
                            under the skin of the chest through which the catheter is passed. It usually takes 30–45 minutes.

                            Despite the name, a permcath is not permanent for life. It is meant for medium-term use and can remain
                            for months if cared for properly. It is usually removed once a permanent access like an AV fistula is ready.

                            An AV fistula is the best long-term dialysis access because it lasts longer and has a lower infection risk.
                            A permcath is used when dialysis must start immediately or when a fistula is not yet ready.

                            Perm catheterization plays a crucial role in providing immediate and safe dialysis access. With proper

                            is established.
