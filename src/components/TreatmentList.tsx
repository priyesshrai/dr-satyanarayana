                        Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), also known as Acute Renal Failure, is a sudden loss of kidney function that develops within hours or days. It causes waste and fluid to build up in the body, which can be life-threatening if not treated quickly.

                        Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. If not treated on time, CKD can progress to renal failure, where kidneys stop working completely and require dialysis or a transplant.

                        Kidney transplantation is a surgical procedure where a healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor is placed into a patient whose kidneys have failed. It is often the best treatment option for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), offering improved quality of life compared to long-term dialysis.

                        Dialysis is a life-saving treatment for patients whose kidneys can no longer filter waste and excess fluid from the blood. It can be done through Hemodialysis, where blood is cleaned using a dialysis machine, or Peritoneal Dialysis, where a cleansing fluid is used inside the abdomen.
